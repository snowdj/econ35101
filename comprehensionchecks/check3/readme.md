### Location choice and compensating differentials with heterogeneous agents

If we ignore sectoral assignments and agglomeration economies and restrict attention to a single city, the locational assignment problem of [Davis and Dingel - The Comparative Advantage of Cities](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jonathan.dingel/research/DavisDingel-TheComparativeAdvantageofCities.pdf) is a familiar model from urban economics.
See Kevin Murphy's lectures on ["Chapter 8: Location Choice" on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp2AOdiHSxGeV8AwAwm7nye_2QsQHiC6D).

Using the Davis and Dingel notation, suppose that there is a single city in which skill &omega; earns income G(&omega;) and the total population is *L*.
Let *A*(*c*) = 1 for this city.
The city is monocentric with linear commuting costs:
T(&tau;) = d<sub>1</sub> - d<sub>2</sub> &tau; and S(&tau;) = &pi; &tau;^2.
For simplicity, let G(&omega;) = *g* &omega;, where *g* is a constant, and assume skill is uniformly distributed,
&omega; ~ U(\underbar{\omega},\bar{\omega}).

Please answer the following questions:
1. Show that \bar{\tau} and \underbar{\gamma} depend only on the exogenous parameters *L*, *d<sub>1</sub>*, *d<sub>2</sub>*.
2. The rent at the city edge \bar{\tau} is zero. What is the rent at the center of the city, &tau;=0?
3. Suppose that *g* increases. What happens to the rent schedule? What happens to the equilibrium utility of each skill level?
4. What happens to the equilibrium utility of \bar{\omega} if the value of \underbar{\omega} increases? (skill compression)
5. What happens to the equilibrium utility of \underbar{\omega} if the value of \bar{\omega} increases? (skill dilation)
