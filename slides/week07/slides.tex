\begin{quote}
The problem with country-level data, in a nutshell, is that they are not sufficiently informative.
Countries do not produce anything and countries do not trade with one another.
Firms and consumers do these things.
Exactly how one intended or expected to measure the impact of trade on incomes without any reference to firms and/or households is something of a puzzle.

Five summary facts about firms in international trade
\begin{itemize}
\item Very few firms export:  4\% of 5.5 million US firms are exporters %BJRS JEP 2007
\item A few firms dominate exporting: top 10\% of exporters account for 96\% of exports  %BJRS JEP 2007
\item Exporters are bigger than non-exporters: Average exporting firm is twice the size of average non-exporter   %BJRS JEP 2007
\item Art Vandelay: More than 50\% of importing firms export  %Table 1 and maybe more from http://www.nber.org/chapters/c0500.pdf

  \item Exporters are more likely to enter new markets geographically contiguous with current export destinations (\href{http://www.martinalawless.com/Papers/marginaldistance.pdf}{Lawless \emph{OER} 2013})
  \item Sharing a border reduces estimated entry cost for Chilean chemical manufacturers by 20\%-40\% (\href{https://sites.google.com/site/edumoralescasado/files/ExtendedGravity.pdf?attredirects=0}{Morales et al 2015})

\begin{frame}{Trade liberalization and reallocation across firms}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decompose change in aggregate productivity into between- and within-firm components
\item Finding that trade liberalization raised shares of more productive firms motived theoretical work on heterogeneous firms
\item Measuring firm-level TFP is plagued by simultaneity and selection biases
\item Measuring TFP is hard: see recent survey by Jan de Loecker and Penny Goldberg that emphasizes profitability vs productivity, TFPQ vs TFPR, markups, learning by exporting, and so forth
\item Pavcnik (2002) is an early and influential paper that applied Olley and Pakes (1996) technique to estimate TFP and assess Chile's 1970s trade liberalization
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Pavcnik (2002)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Chile liberalized trade 1974-1979 (tariffs ``often surpassing 100\% in 1974'' reduced to uniform 10\%)
\item Pavcnik has plant-level panel data for 1979-1986
\item No plant-level data on exporting behavior
\item Classify industries as import-competing, export-oriented, or non-tradable based on penetration (doesn't use tariff rates)
\item Exit is important: 35\% of plants exited between 1979 and 1986; exiting plants on average 8\% less productive than survivors
\item Industry productivity growth decomposed into unweighted average and share-productivity covariance (Table 3) shows 2/3 of aggregate productivity improvement due to between-plant shifts
\item Industry productivity regressed on orientation $\times$ year dummies (Table 4) shows substantial productivity increases 1979-1986 for import-competing sectors compared to non-tradables and no such improvements for export-oriented sectors
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Melitz (Ecma 2003)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Melitz (2003) is a model with heterogeneous firms and fixed costs of exporting that can speak to productivity premia and trade liberalization causing intra-industry reallocation
\item One of the most cited papers of last 20 years (\href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SqlfKBsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao}{15k GS})
\item Two building blocks:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Krugman (AER 1980): CES preferences, IRS technology, monopolistic competition
	\item Hopenhayn (JPE 1992): equilibrium model of entry and exit
\end{enumerate}
\item Are trade-induced reallocations of labor from less to more productive firms a ``new'' source of gains from trade?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Preferences and production}
As in Krugman (1980), representative agent has CES preferences:
$$ U = \left[\int_{\omega\in\Omega} q(\omega)^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}} \textrm{d} \omega \right]^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}} $$
Consumption and expenditure on each variety are
$$
q(\omega) = Q \left[\frac{p(\omega)}{P}\right]^{-\sigma}
\qquad
r(\omega) = R \left[\frac{p(\omega)}{P}\right]^{1-\sigma}
$$
where $P\equiv \left[\int_{\omega\in\Omega} p(\omega)^{1-\sigma} \textrm{d} \omega \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}$
and $R\equiv \int_{\omega\in\Omega} r(\omega) \textrm{d} \omega$
\medskip
As in Krugman (1980), endowed labor $L$ is only factor of production with wage $w$ and IRS production function has fixed cost and constant marginal cost
\begin{align*}
l = f + q/\varphi 
&& 
p(\varphi) = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}\frac{w}{\varphi}
\\
r(\varphi) = R \left(P\rho\varphi\right)^{\sigma-1} 
&&
\pi(\varphi) = \frac{1}{\sigma} r(\varphi) - f
\end{align*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Decentralized equilibrium is efficient}
See \href{https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831401}{Dixit and Stiglitz (1977)} and \href{https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/700732}{Dhingra and Morrow (2019)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decentralized equilibrium solves revenue maximization:
$$
\max_{q_i,n} \int_{0}^{n} p_i(q_i) q_i \textrm{d}i 
\qquad
\text{ s.t. }
nf +  \int_{0}^{n} q_i / \varphi_{i} \textrm{d}i \leq L
$$
\item Social planner solves:
$$
\max_{q_i,n} \int_{0}^{n} q_i^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}} \textrm{d}i 
\qquad
\text{ s.t. }
nf +  \int_{0}^{n} q_i / \varphi_{i} \textrm{d}i \leq L
$$
\item CES preferences and constant marginal costs make 
$r(\varphi) \propto \varphi^{\sigma-1}, q(\varphi) \propto \varphi^{\sigma}\Rightarrow p_i(q_i) q_i \propto q_i^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}$, so solutions coincide
\item Thus, many aggregate properties of Melitz (2003) coincide with those of perfectly competitive models
\item As is so often the case, CES is a very special demand system
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Aggregate outcomes (closed economy)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since all firms with productivity $\varphi$ charge same price $p(\varphi)$,
$$
P
\equiv
\left[\int_{\omega\in\Omega} p(\omega)^{1-\sigma} \textrm{d} \omega \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}} 
=
\left[\int_{0}^{+\infty} p(\varphi)^{1-\sigma} M \mu(\varphi) \textrm{d} \varphi \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}} 
$$
where $M$ is mass of active firms and $\mu(\varphi)$ conditional pdf of active productivities in equilibrium
\item Using $p(\varphi) = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}\frac{w}{\varphi}$, write this as $P = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1} w M^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}} \tilde{\varphi}$
$$
\tilde{\varphi} \equiv \left[\int_{0}^{+\infty} \varphi^{\sigma-1} \mu(\varphi) \textrm{d} \varphi \right]^{\frac{1}{\sigma-1}}
$$
\item Similarly, other aggregate variables can be written
$$
R = M r(\tilde{\varphi})
\quad
\Pi = M \pi(\tilde{\varphi})
\quad
Q = M^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}} q(\tilde{\varphi})
$$
\item Aggregates are same as those in a Krugman model with mass $M$ of homogeneous firms with productivity $\tilde{\varphi}$
\item But $\tilde{\varphi}$ is endogenous and may depend on trade costs
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Entry and exit}
To determine equilibrium $\mu(\varphi)$ and $\tilde{\varphi}$, must specify the entry and exit process for firms. 
Similar to Hopenhayn (1992):
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a large pool of identical potential entrants
\item Entrants pay a fixed cost of entry $f_e>0$ and draw productivity $\varphi$ from $G(\cdot)$
\item After observing their $\varphi$, firm chooses to produce or exit
\item Active firms exogenously exit with constant probability of death $\delta$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In stationary equilibrium, active firm earns $\pi(\varphi)$ each period
	\item There is a unique productivity cutoff $\varphi^*$ and, given the fixed cost, it is defined by $\pi(\varphi^*)=0$
	\item The conditional pdf $\mu(\varphi) = \frac{g(\varphi)}{1-G(\varphi^*)}$ on support $[\varphi^*,\infty)$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Free-entry and zero-cutoff conditions}
Free-entry condition
\begin{itemize}
\item Entry cost equals expected profits $f_e = \frac{1}{\delta} \frac{\Pi}{M} \left[1-G(\varphi^*)\right] $
\item Free-entry condition is therefore
$$ \bar{\pi} \equiv \frac{\Pi}{M} = \frac{\delta f_e}{1-G(\varphi^*)}$$
\item Higher cutoff $\Rightarrow$ entrants need higher average profits for survivors
\end{itemize}
Zero-cutoff condition
\begin{itemize}
	\item By definition of $\bar{\pi}$,
	$$ \bar{\pi} = \pi(\tilde{\varphi}(\varphi^*)) \iff 
	\bar{\pi} = 
	\pi(\varphi) = \frac{1}{\sigma} r(\tilde{\varphi}(\varphi^*)) - f
	$$
	\item By definition of $\varphi^*$,
	$ \pi(\varphi^*)=0 \iff r(\varphi^*) = \sigma f $
	\item Zero-cutoff condition is therefore
	$$ \bar{\pi} = f \left[\left(\frac{\tilde{\varphi}(\varphi^*)}{\varphi^*}\right)^{\sigma-1} - 1\right] $$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Equilibrium $\varphi^*$ and $\bar{\pi}$}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../images/Melitz2003_fig1.pdf}
\begin{itemize}
\item Both free-entry and zero-cutoff conditions are independent of $L$
\item Zero-cutoff condition is not necessarily downward sloping
\item For Pareto distribution ($1 - G(\varphi) = a \varphi^b$), $\frac{\tilde{\varphi}(\varphi^*)}{\varphi^*}$ is constant so ZCP is horizontal
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Size, varieties, welfare, and free-trade equilibrium}
\begin{itemize}
\item Equilibrium still requires determination of $M$, obtain that from total labor hired, as in Krugman (1980)
\item Set wage as numeraire
\item Free entry and labor market clearing say $L=R = M r(\tilde{\varphi})$
$\Rightarrow M = \frac{1}{\sigma(\bar{\pi} + f)} L $
\item Welfare is $U = 1/P = \frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma} M^{\frac{1}{\sigma-1}} \tilde{\varphi}$
\item Since $\bar{\pi}$ and $\varphi^*$ are independent of size, 
greater size and costless trade are essentially isomorphic, as in Krugman (1980)
\item There is no reallocation of market shares across firms when comparing autarky and free trade
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Introducing trade costs}
\begin{itemize}
\item (Assume identical country sizes to shut down terms of trade)
\item Iceberg trade costs $\tau$ and fixed export cost $f_x$
\item Prices are
$p_d(\varphi) = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1} \frac{1}{\varphi}$
and
$p_x(\varphi) = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1} \frac{\tau}{\varphi}$
\item Revenues are
$$r_d(\varphi) = R_d \left(P_d\rho\varphi\right)^{\sigma-1}
\qquad
r_x(\varphi) = \tau^{1-\sigma}R_x \left(P_x\rho\varphi\right)^{\sigma-1}$$
\item By symmetry, $P_d = P_x = P$ and $R_d = R_x = R$
\item Profits are
$$
\pi_d(\varphi) = \frac{1}{\sigma} r_d(\varphi) - f
\quad 
\pi_x(\varphi) = \frac{1}{\sigma} r_x(\varphi) - f_x
$$
\item Total profits are $\pi(\varphi) = \pi_d(\varphi) + \max\{0,\pi_x(\varphi)\}$
\item Cutoffs are now defined as $\varphi^*$ and $\varphi^*_x$
\item Assume $\tau^{\sigma-1}f_x > f$ so that there are non-exporters ($\varphi^*_x>\varphi^*$)
\item Draw the $\pi_d(\varphi), \pi_x(\varphi)$ functions against $\varphi^{\sigma-1}$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Aggregate outcomes for open economy}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the open economy, aggregate productivity is now given by
$$
\tilde{\varphi}_t = 
\left\{\frac{M}{M_t}\tilde{\varphi}^{\sigma-1} + n \frac{M_x}{M_t} (\tilde{\varphi}_x/\tau)^{\sigma-1} \right\}
$$
\item $M_t \equiv M + n M_x$ is total number of varieties
\item $\tilde{\varphi} \equiv \left[ \frac{1}{1-G(\varphi^*)} \int_{\varphi^*}^{+\infty} \varphi^{\sigma-1} g(\varphi) \textrm{d} \varphi \right]^{\frac{1}{\sigma-1}}$ is average of all firms
\item $\tilde{\varphi}_x \equiv \left[ \frac{1}{1-G(\varphi_x^*)} \int_{\varphi_x^*}^{+\infty} \varphi^{\sigma-1} g(\varphi) \textrm{d} \varphi \right]^{\frac{1}{\sigma-1}}$ is average of exporters
\item We can again write aggregate variables in terms of $\tilde{\varphi}_t$ but this relies heavily on symmetry (welfare depends on productivity of foreign exporters!)
$$
P = \frac{1}{\rho} M_t^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}} \tilde{\varphi}_t
\quad 
R = M_t r(\tilde{\varphi}_t)
\quad
\Pi = M_t \pi(\tilde{\varphi}_t)
\quad
Q = M_t^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}} q(\tilde{\varphi}_t)
$$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% -----------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Free-entry and zero-cutoff conditions in open economy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Free-entry condition is same as before ($\delta f_e = \bar{\pi}[1-G(\varphi^*)]$), recognizing that $\bar{\pi} = \pi_d(\tilde{\varphi}) + n p_x  \pi_x(\tilde{\varphi}_x)$ where $p_x = \frac{1-G({\varphi}_x^*)}{1-G(\varphi^*)}$.
\item Zero-cutoff condition is now derived from $r_d(\varphi^*) = \sigma f$ and $r_x(\varphi^*_x) = \sigma f_x$, which jointly imply
$$ 
\frac{r_x(\varphi^*_x)}{r_d(\varphi^*)} = \frac{f_x}{f}
\iff
\varphi^*_x = \varphi^* \tau (f_x /f)^{1/(\sigma-1)}
$$
\item Rearranging $\bar{\pi}$ to be a function of $\varphi^*$ delivers
$$
\bar{\pi} 
=
f \left[\left(\frac{\tilde{\varphi}(\varphi^*)}{\varphi^*}\right)^{\sigma-1} - 1\right]
+
n p_x f_x \left[\left(\frac{\tilde{\varphi}_x(\varphi^*)}{\varphi_x^*(\varphi^*)}\right)^{\sigma-1} - 1\right]
$$
\item This ZCP has shifted up relative to closed-economy ZCP

\begin{frame}{Measuring productivity in Melitz (2003) setting}
\begin{itemize}
\item With only one input, output quantity per worker is TFPQ
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\text{physical output}}{\text{variable workers}}
=
\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\tau _{ij}x_{ij}\left(\varphi\right)}

\item Many countries, many industries, CES preferences
\item Many firms within each industry with CRS technologies, iceberg trade costs, and heterogeneous productivities competing on price
\item Price charged by least-cost firm in each industry is bounded by the second lowest cost (from same or different country)
\item The joint distribution of highest and second-highest productivities is key:

Melitz's fixed-cost story faces an empirical tension

	\item Many exporters only export small amounts, which suggests that fixed exporting costs are small
	\item Arkolakis (2010) extends Chaney (2008) with endogenous marketing costs to explain size distribution of exporters
	\item Fixed cost of reaching consumers in $j$ with probability $x$ is
	$$
	f_{ij}(x) = f_{ij} \times \left[\frac{1-(1-x)^{1-\mu}}{1-\mu}\right]

Quantitative exercise to move past Melitz's qualitative match. Motivating facts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Firms do not enter markets according to an exact hierarchy. 
	\item Their sales where they do enter deviate from the exact correlations the basic model insists on.
	\item Firms that export sell too much in France. 
	\item In the typical destination, there are too many firms selling small amounts.
\end{enumerate}
Approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce market and firm-specific heterogeneity in entry costs and demand
	\item Incorporate Arkolakis (2010) formulation of market access costs
	\item Estimate via SMM: Raw efficiency (Melitz story) explains 57\% of variation in extensive margin
	\item Do a counterfactual cut in trade costs

The argument
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes in trade costs can have large effects on individual firms' innovation decisions without affecting aggregate welfare
\end{itemize}
The model
\begin{itemize}
	\item Heterogeneous firms produce differentiated CES products incurring fixed and variable export costs as in Melitz (2003)
	\item Model of innovation builds on Griliches (1979)
	\item Firms profit opportunities determined by firm-specific factor (productivity)
	\item \textit{Process} innovation: Increase stock of specific factor in existing firm
	\item \textit{Product} innovation: Create new firms with new initial stock of factor

What is the effect of a change in marginal trade costs on aggregate productivity?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Direct effect} is change in aggregate productivity holding fixed firms' exit, export, process, and product innovation decisions
\item \textit{Indirect effect} is changes in firms' exit, export, process, and product innovation decisions caused by the change in trade costs
\item Krugman (1980) has only the product innovation margin
\item Main result: Adding firm heterogeneity and process innovation changes consequences for aggregate productivity little because 
the increase in productivity of average firm 
from changes in exit and export decisions and reallocation of process innovation from non-exporters to exporters 
is offset by production innovation
\item The logic: Firms' free-entry condition constrains the overall response of aggregate productivity to changes in trade costs
\item Lower trade costs raise innovation by current and prospective exporters, but this also reduces entrants' expected profits

Innovation requires employing the research good
\begin{itemize}
	\item Process innovation: Invest $\exp(z)c(q)$ units to have 
	$\exp(z+\Delta_z)^{1/(\rho-1)}$ with probability $q$
	and
	$\exp(z-\Delta_z)^{1/(\rho-1)}$ with probability $1-q$
	with $c',c''>0$
	\item Product innovation: Invest $n_e$ units to produce new firm in $t+1$ with state variable $s$ drawn from $G$
\end{itemize}
Special case 1: All firms export ($n_x=0$)
\begin{itemize}
\item Absent fixed costs of exporting, a decline in the marginal cost of exporting affects all (active) firms' profits proportionally.
\item Free-entry condition requires this increase in profits be exactly offset by increase in cost of research good that produces both innovations.
\item The indirect effect corresponds entirely to a change in product innovation.
